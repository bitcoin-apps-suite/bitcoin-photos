# Bitcoin Photos Development Roadmap

## Platform Analysis Summary

After analyzing the bitcoin-photos codebase and comparing it with bitcoin-writer, bitcoin-drive, and bitcoin-spreadsheets, we've identified key patterns and requirements for building a complete photo management and Auto-NFT trading platform.

### Shared Infrastructure Patterns
- **Bitcoin SV Integration**: All platforms use BSV for transactions and smart contracts
- **Unified Authentication**: Shared wallet-based login system across Bitcoin Apps
- **Token Economics**: Each platform has its own utility token ($bWriter, $bDrive, $bSheets, $bPhotos)
- **File Management**: Decentralized storage with encryption and access controls
- **Trading Engine**: Share-based tokenization and marketplace functionality
- **Cross-Platform Integration**: Seamless navigation between Bitcoin Apps

### Current Bitcoin Photos State
- ✅ **UI/UX Foundation**: Modern React/Next.js interface with Bitcoin branding
- ✅ **Component Architecture**: Reusable components and design system
- ✅ **Mock Data Integration**: Photo galleries and trading interfaces
- ❌ **Backend Infrastructure**: No real data persistence or blockchain integration
- ❌ **Authentication System**: No user management or wallet integration
- ❌ **Token Contract**: $bPhotos token not implemented
- ❌ **Auto-NFT Engine**: Core functionality missing
- ❌ **Real Trading**: Mock trading interface only

## Development Phases

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Critical Priority)
**Estimated Timeline: 4-6 weeks**

### Phase 2: Auto-NFT & Trading (High Priority)  
**Estimated Timeline: 6-8 weeks**

### Phase 3: Advanced Features (Medium Priority)
**Estimated Timeline: 4-6 weeks**

### Phase 4: Platform Expansion (Low Priority)
**Estimated Timeline: 8-10 weeks**
